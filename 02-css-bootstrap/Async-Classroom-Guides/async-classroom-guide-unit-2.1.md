Whenever you are ready, move on to the day’s warm-up: a recap of week 1’s lessons.

### 00:49 to 08:59 - Instructor Do: Recapping

It’s been a whirlwind of a first week! Let’s take a moment to recap some of the main concepts that we have learned so far.

### 09:05 to 20:06 - Instructor Do: Double Take

Now that we are caught up on the main concepts, let’s take a deep dive into some more advanced concepts for new developers.

Watch the video through the timestamps above. As before, take note of concepts that you still need help with. Don’t be afraid to pause the video and spend some time googling for answers. Take your time and pace yourself!

### 30:31 to 34:38 - Demo: Multiple CSS

Open up the student bio you created during week 1 in your editor. Use it to compare your file structure to the one showcased in the video. 

Ask yourself:

  - How might you benefit from separating your CSS files as shown?
  - Why does the order of the CSS matter?

Ready to learn more? The next section covers how to anticipate CSS standard differences across different browsers, by implementing CSS resets.

### 34:45 to 40:52 - Demo: CSS Resets

### 57:21 to 01:01:35 - Demo: Deploying to GitHub Pages - Projects

Follow along with the demo to learn how to deploy project pages on GitHub.
