## Unit 2.3 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/MtIJJJgx-Eo](https://youtu.be/MtIJJJgx-Eo)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To gain a conceptual understanding of the role of grid-based web design in modern web development
    - To utilize the Bootstrap grid system to create complete web layouts
    - To understand the concept of mobile responsive web design and the use of media queries to achieve it 
  - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 04:13 - Welcome

Get ready. Get yourself a cup of water. Open up your editor. Be ready with your class activity files.

All good? Let's get started with some quick admin items.

### 04:20 to 06:46 - Today's Class

Now that we are caught up on admin items, take a look at today's class objectives.

Watch the video through the timestamps above. As quick reminder, the focus will be on: 

  - To gain a conceptual understanding of the role of grid-based web design in modern web development
  - To utilize the Bootstrap grid system to create complete web layouts
  - To understand the concept of mobile responsive web design and the use of media queries to achieve it .

Keep in mind that the slides on screen may not 100% match what's written here. Favor the content in this guide. It has been updated for clarity.

Once ready, move on to the next section for a quick recap of Bootsrap's role in CSS styling.

### 06:52 to 12:16 - Instructor Do: Recap Bootstrap

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above for a recap of Bootstrap.

Need a quick summary? We've got you covered:

  - Once Bootstrap is active, you can simply copy snippets from the documentation to save yourself the time of creating elements yourself. 
  - One of the most compelling reasons to use Bootstrap is the default mobile-responsive quality it provides. 
  - This means that your websites will automatically look “good” when viewed on screens ranging from monitors to tablets to phones. 

Once ready, move on to the next section for an activity where you can put your skills to the test.

### 12:22 to 13:07 - Students Do: Warmup Bootstrap Component Activity

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video.

When you are ready, follow the instructions below to complete this activity. 

  - As a repeat of last class, quickly create an HTML web page.
  - Then add in a Bootstrap component of your choosing.
  - _Hint:_ Copy the Bootstrap CSS link. Then copy the code from any Bootstrap element or CSS.

Once done, unpause the video and watch the instructor review to make sure you have everything right.  

Remember, don't spend too much time on this activity. It's just a warm-up!

### 13:14 to 15:30 - Instructor Do: Review Warmup Bootstrap Component Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to see how other students handled this activity. Take this time to reflect on topics that you might still need to brush up on.

### 15:36 to 28:27 - Instructor Do: Sketching / Grid Layouts

Alright! Get ready. In our opinion, these next two sections are key to the program.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above, and _take notes!_

We know that this can be a bit overwhelming, so here's a quick summary of tools and topics to revisit.

  - Designing with Grids Guides:
