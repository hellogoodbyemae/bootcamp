## Unit 2.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/mzDea2TyRqI](https://youtu.be/mzDea2TyRqI)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To work with CSS properties used for adjusting a website's typography
    - To utilize custom fonts provided from Google Fonts
    - To work with CSS pseudo classes to style elements based on special states
    - To utilize the Bootstrap CSS framework for website development
  - Be sure to write down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 06:00 to 00:58 - Welcome

Get ready. Get yourself a cup of water. Open up your editor. Be ready with your class activity files.

All good? Let's get started with some quick admin items.

### 01:05 to 10:16 - Admin Items

We're halfway into week 2! Think of all you have learned. How might you apply these lessons in your work? How about your homework? Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to listen to some important reminders about the structure of the class. Keep in mind, though, this video is from a previous class. Remember to follow-up with your instructor for any further clarifications.

Oh, and a quick note to address some feedback about the class: Books can be helpful when you’re learning on your own. But, in a boot camp like this, they can be distracting, especially when class is moving so quickly. When you’re at home, focus your efforts on completing your homework, reviewing in-class exercises, and going over slides. Invest in books and outside tutorials _after_ you finish the program.

Once you are ready, move on to the next section to get familiarized with what today's class is going to cover.

### 10:23 to 11:26 - Today's Class

Now that we are caught up on admin items, take a look at today's class objectives by watching the video through the timestamps above. As quick reminder, the focus will be on: 

  - To work with CSS properties used for adjusting a website's typography
  - To utilize custom fonts provided from Google Fonts
  - To work with CSS pseudo classes to style elements based on special states
  - To utilize the Bootstrap CSS framework for website development

Keep in mind that the slides on screen may not 100% match what's written here. Favor the content in this guide. It has been updated for clarity.

### 11:32 to 16:20 - Instructor Do: CSS Typography

Welcome to the wonderful world of Typography!

It may seem like a small thing, but font type plays a _huge_ role in the aesthetics of a site. Watch the video through the timestamps above to learn about best practices for Typography in web development, as well as to get familiarized with important CSS properties related to Typography.

Here's a quick summary to help you stay on track:

  - Line Height: Distance between lines of text on a page (Golden Ratio of 1.5x font).
    - If you need help with the math (like myself), check out this [Golden Ratio Calculator](https://grtcalculator.com/)
  - Font Size: Actual size of lettering. Should be at least 16 px on modern pages. 
    - You might be wondering where that number comes from. Check out this [quick article on the topic](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake) to find out more!
  - Line Length: Not a CSS property, it's a standard: About 50–75 characters per line on a desktop.
  - Letter Spacing: Spacing between individual letters. Try to avoid cramming letters together too closely.
  - Sans-Serif vs. Serif: Sans-serif are fonts without their serifs—no tails. They’re easier to read online.

Think you've got it? Then head over to the next section for a demo that includes the use of readily available custom fonts that you can find online!

### 16:27 to 24:36 - Instructor Demo: Custom Fonts 

Watch the video through the timestamps above to follow-along with a demo on custom fonts. Feel free to pause the video whenever necessary to catch up, or briefly explore on your own. And, before you start, be sure to have the [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) page open and ready for action.

Once you've gotten through this demo, get ready for an activity where you'll have to do this on your own.

### 24:43 to 25:21 - Students Do: Custom Fonts Activity

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video.

When you are ready, open up `07-CSSTypography` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity.

Once done, unpause the video and watch the instructor recap to make sure you have everything right.

### 25:27 to 27:32 - Instructor Do: Pseudo Styles

Normally, we would follow this up with a review. This time, however, we're going to combine two lessons and do one more activity before checking our work together.

Watch the video through the time stamps indicated above to learn all about Pseudo Styles in CSS.  Remember, the main takeaway here is that CSS provides keywords that can be added to selectors. These keywords can highlight the special states of the selected element.

Be sure to take notes! There's a demo and an activity coming up.

### 27:38 to 29:36 - Instructor Do: Pseudo Styles Demo

You know the drill! Let's follow up this lesson with a quick demo. Try to follow along by watching the video through the timestamps above, and don't forget to pause whenever necessary. Take your time. There's no rush! 

Once ready, move on to the next section for an activity where you can apply Pseudo Classes to CSS properties in your own work!

### 29:43 to 30:47 - Groups Do: Pseudo Styles Activity

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video.

When you are ready, open up `07-CSSTypography` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity.

Once done, unpause the video and watch the instructor recap to make sure you have everything right.

### 30:53 to 34:46 - Instructor Do: Review Pseudo Styles Activity

What’s better than developing your own webpage? How about taking it live to share it with the world! Watch the video through the timestamp indicated above to learn about deploying static pages through GitHub Pages.

Note that there are two types of pages that we will learn to deploy:

  - Personal/organization sites for your account
  - Sites that are specific to a project/repository

Take notes as you watch the video, then get ready to watch a demo of each type of deployment described above.

### 34:52 to 35:34  - BREAK

Time for a break!

Pause the video, stretch your legs, and take some time to reflect on what we’ve learned so far.

### 35:41 to 40:46 -Instructor Do: Beyond CSS Hacking

Welcome back! This is a quick note taking section, so watch the video through time stamp above and let's get started.

To recap, HTML and CSS are the “languages of the web.” Together, they define both the content and the aesthetics of a webpage, including colors, fonts, and content placement. (JavaScript is the third language of the web: it handles logic, animation, etc.). In other words:

  - HTML alone
    - Like writing papers in Notepad.
    - Used to write unformatted text (i.e, content only).
  - HTML and CSS
    - Like writing papers in Microsoft Word.
    - Used both to write the content and format it (color, font, alignment, layout, etc.).

Are you with us? Put your knowledge to the test in the next activity.

### 40:52 to 41:20 - Students Do: Pre-Defined CSS Activity

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video.

When you are ready, open up `10-WheresCSS` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

As you do this activity, ask yourself:

  - Where's the CSS?
  - Where is the HTML document drawing its styles from?
  - How does our browser know which element to style in which way? (ex: button face or background banner)

_Hint_: We've used something similar with Google Fonts.

Once done, unpause the video and watch the instructor recap to make sure you have everything right.

### 41:26 to 42:21 - Instructor Review: Pre-Defined CSS Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to see how other students answered this activity.

Ready to keep going? Move on to the next section to learn more about Bootstrap and predefined CSS.

### 42:27 to 45:12- Instructor Do: What's Bootstrap
