## Unit 1.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

  - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/NrdImKb9toY](https://youtu.be/NrdImKb9toY)
  - Be ready with your activity files form class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
  - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To introduce basic terminal/bash commands
    - To create a basic HTML page
  - Be sure to write down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 02:58 - Tech Check

Get ready. You will need to have your class activity files open for today's class.

Also, keep in mind that this video skips the instructor's personal introduction. You should reach out to your own instructional team to get any context relevant to your class in particular.

After you've gone through this tech check, move on to the next section to hear about the mindset behind this course.

### 03:04 to 17:38 - Instructor Do: The Path of Learning

Watch the slideshow in the video through the timestamps indicated above. In it, the instructor relays some perspective on some of the pains and frustrations that you might experience throughout this course. The learning curve is steep, and it is up to you to set yourself up for success by acknowledging these difficulties.

After you've gone through the above, continue on to the next section to recap the course structure.

### 17:45 to 25:59 - Instructor Do: Course Structure

This is another introductory section, this time focused on the overall structure of the course.

Watch the video as indicated. The main takeaway is that learning to code requires... well, coding (not just sitting through lectures). So, this program will very quickly become "code-centric." There will be a mix of individual and group activities / projects. Today will have a little bit of this back and forth, and we will grow from there.

When you're all done here, get ready for a break.

### 26:05 to 26:26 - BREAK!

Stretch your legs for 15 minutes. Try to reflect on what we've learned so far. When you come back, we'll start with our first few lessons on web development!

### 26:32 to 31:32 - Instructor Do: On the Modern Web

To start, what do you think "Full-Stack Development" is? 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to head the instructor's explanation. Some of this may seem obvious (you _are_ enrolled in a fullstack development course, after all). But, this will help further contextualize the course structure, and our approach to learning.

When you are done with this, let's get crackin'!

### 31:38 to 53:16 - Instructor Do: Let's Get Crackin'—Intro to Console / Bash

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review basic console / Bash commands.

To recap, these are the commands to learn:

  - cd (changes directory)
  - cd ~ (changes to home directory)
  - cd .. (moves up one directory)
  - ls (lists files in folder)
  - pwd (shows current directory)
  - mkdir <FOLDERNAME> (creates new directory)
  - touch <FILENAME> (creates a file)
  - rm <FILENAME> (deletes file)
  - rm -r <FOLDERNAME> (deletes a folder, note the -r)
  - open . (opens the current folder. MAC SPECIFIC)
  - open <FILENAME> (opens a specific file. MAC SPECIFIC)
  - explorer <FILENAME> (opens the specific file. BASH SPECIFIC)
  - explorer . (opens the current folder. BASH SPECIFIC)

When you are done here, prepare for an activity to review your understanding of these commands.

### 53:23 to 56:15 - Groups Do: Console Commands

Of course, you will be working solo for this activity. Give it your best shot, and don't forget to reach out to your instructional staff to get any context relevant to how "groups" are being handled in your class in particular.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above. Then, using only the command line, create the following:

  - A new folder with the name of first_day_stuff
  - A new HTML file with the name of first-day.html
  - Open the current folder containing the new HTML file.

BONUS:

  - Create multiple directories/folders with the names one_folder and second_folder in one command.
  - Create multiple files with the names one.html and two.html in one command in the first_day_stuff directory.

When you've got it, head over to the next section for a review.

### 56:22 to 01:00:28 - Instructor Do: Console Commands Solution

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution.

How'd you do? You will be a Console/Bash expert in no time.

### 01:00:35 to 01:01:11 - Groups Do: Discuss with Group

Heads up: This activity requires a partner. Instead, try to write down your own explanations, as if you had to present the concept to someone else. Can you do it?

Watch the video as indicated to get the full context on this activity. In a nutshell, explain at a high-level definition of "full-stack development."

Then, get ready for an introduction to HTML.

### 01:01:18 to 01:18:48 - Instructor Do: Hello, HTML

This course will include a number of demos, much like this one!

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to watch the instructor's overview of HTML pages. In fact, open up your own editor and try to follow along.

When you're through, get ready for your first coding activity.

### 01:18:54 to 01:21:23 - Students Do: Intro to HTML

It's time for your first coding activity.

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. Feel free to rewind the video afterwards, in case you need to reference the code from the previous section.

To recap, the instructions are to, in a new HTML file, create the basic structure of an HTML document and include the following in it:

  - DOCTYPE declaration
  - Head tag with a title tag
  - H1 tag with a title of your choice
  - Embed an image
  - Create the following three links on your page:
    - One link that is target="_blank" so that it opens a new tab when clicked on.
    - Make the second link bold.
    - Make the third link a placeholder so it goes nowhere.

_HINT:_ You should be looking up at the screen pretty often :P

Up for a challenge? Try the Bonus:

  - Create an ordered list of steps to make a sandwich.
  - Create an unordered list of 5 bands/musicians you like.
  - Create a table with 2 columns (animal class and animal name) and 4 rows of animals.
  - Use an alternate way of separating links without line breaks.
  - Embed a YouTube video of your favorite band/musician.

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your code.

### 01:21:30 to 01:32:39 - Instructor Do: Review HTML Solution

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution for this activity. 

How'd you do? You'll find that a lot of this will become second nature as you progress through the course. Keep an ear out for student questions, as well. They may help clarify questions of your own.

When you are ready, un pause the video to close out the class.

### 01:32:46 to 01:33:00 - Class Closing

Class is over. Great work!

Be sure to follow-up with your instructional staff for any context specific to your class.

Happy coding!
