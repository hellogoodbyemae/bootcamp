### 00:06 to 01:14 - Class Introduction

Get ready. Do you have your activity files open? Your editor? How about a cup of water? Self care is important.

The next section covers a series of admin items. Don’t skip it! While the video you will watch is based on a previous class, be mindful that many of these considerations might apply to your own class. Give it a watch, and take note of any follow-ups you might want to bring to office-hours.

### 01:21 to  02:46 - Admin Items

Point of advice, take the messages of this section to heart. Always Be Coding (ABC). It’s the only way that you will improve!

Oh, and also, don’t forget about homework. Reach out to your instructional staff ASAP if you have any questions about homework expectations.

### 02:52 to  04:50 - Instructor Do: Today's Class - Objectives + Focus Items

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the day’s objectives once more with the rest of the class. Which topic are most knowledgeable in? The least knowledgeable?

Before continuing, take a glance at the rest of the guide to get an idea of how the day will be structured. Once ready, continue to the next section.

### 04:56 to 12:29  - Instructor Do: What/Why Git - "The Group Project" 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to learn about Git version control. As you watch, ask yourself:

  - Why would developers need such a system?
  - What are some code conflict scenarios that Git can help resolve?

When you’re done, move on to the next section for a quick activity on this topic.

### 12:36 to 13:10 - Students Do: Quick Activity - Explain Git

For this activity, take a couple of minutes to come up with your own simple explanation of Git, as if you were teaching the concept to someone.

If you’re working alone, consider the following:

  - Type out your explanation and read it out loud to yourself.
  - Try to explain these concepts to somebody who doesn’t know anything about coding. Did it make sense to them? How can you explain it in even simpler terms?

When you feel confident in your explanation, unpause the video and continue on to the review.

### 13:17 to  16:08 - Instructor Review: Recap Answers

So, after all that, what's GIT for?
Git is the underlying tool that allows you to manage your code.

You can manage and merge different versions of your code, as well as revert to previous versions should you need it.

Of course, it’s not that simple to explain it to just anyone. Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear the explanations proposed by other students.

### 16:14 to  19:01 - Instructor Do: Explain GitHub

### 19:07 to 35:28 -  Instructor Do: Get Started with Git - Demo Git add, commit, push 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above. Follow along and learn to create a GitHub repository, then practice pulling, pushing, and committing code to it.
Note  that you can find a GitHub-Help document in your supplemental files for week 1. 

Reach out to an instructional staff member if you need help finding this file!
Ready to keep pushing? Continue to the next activity to get more practice with Git and GitHub.

### 35:35 to 37:00 - Students Do: Git Add, Commit, Push

It’s time to bring it all together. Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video.

When you are ready to start, pause the video and complete the activity as described below.

Instructions:
  - Using GitHub and the Command Line, do the following:
  - Create a new public GitHub repository, and name it whatever you like. Be sure to check the box for “initialize this repository with a README.”
  - Next, clone the repo to your local directory.
  - Then create an HTML file inside the local directory.
  - Add, Commit, and Push the code to GitHub.

Bonus:
  - Create a new public GitHub repository, and name it zen-garden. Be sure to check the box for “initialize this repository with a README.”
  - Clone the repo to your local directory.
  - Go to CSS Zen Garden. Navigate to a few of the examples and choose a page that you like.
  - Download the HTML and CSS. Each page has a link to download the code, normally near the top of the page.
  - Move the HTML and CSS into your newly cloned repo and open the HTML in Chrome.
  -  Use inspect element to identify a page element you would like to change in some way.
  - Change the CSS in any way you'd like.
  - Add, Commit, and Push the code to GitHub.

When you are ready to continue, unpause the video for a quick review with other students.
