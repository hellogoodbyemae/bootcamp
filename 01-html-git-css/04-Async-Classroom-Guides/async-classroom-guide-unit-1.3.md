  - Be ready with your activity files form class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
  - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To become comfortable working with HTML relative paths
    - To engage in a deep dive of HTML/CSS for layout design and element positioning
    - To complete the Bash Checkpoint.
  - Be sure to write down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 00:46 - Class Introduction

So, by now you should be ready with your activity files from class. Get yourself comfortable, and let’s get ready to learn some HTML and CSS.

### 00:53 to 03:51 - Admin Items

Take a moment to listen to a quick reminder of the upcoming homework assignment. 

Remember to reach out to your instructional staff if you have any questions about this!

### 03:57 to 04:52  - A brief warning and some advice

Take a minute to watch the video through the timestamps indicated above. It’ll help set the stage for the rest of class. 

Remember, everyone’s learning curve is different. So, keep at it! It’ll all start to click soon.

### 04:50 to 12:40 - Instructor Do:  CSS Recap

Before we get started with a deep dive into some new material, let’s take a moment to recap the basics of CSS.

Need a quick refresher? Remember these important points:
  - HTML: Hypertext Markup Language (Content)
  - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (Appearance)
  - HTML/CSS are the “languages of the web.” Together they define both the content and the aesthetics of a webpage, handling everything from layouts, colors, fonts, and content placement.
  - JavaScript is the language that deals with logic, animation, etc.

Once you’ve watched the video through the timestamps indicated above, get ready for the next section, which is a quick demo on how relative file paths to connect your HTML and CSS files.

### 12:26 to 17:26 - Instructor Do: Relative File Paths Slides + Demo

Pull up your notes and your editor, and get ready to follow along with this demo on relative file paths. As you watch the video through the timestamps indicated above, ask yourself, what is the difference between absolute and relative file paths?

Lost? Check out the following resources on the topic:

  - [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/)
  - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/Html/html_filepaths.asp)

Once you think you have a good handle on this topic, unpause the video and move on to the following relative file paths activity.

### 17:33 to 18:06 - Groups Do: Relative File Paths Activity

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video.

When you are ready, open up `07-Relative Paths` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity.

Once done, unpause the video and watch the instructor recap to review the solution.

### 18:12 to 24:04 - Instructor Do: Review Relative File Paths Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to see the solution as demoed by the instructor. Keep an ear out for student questions that may address different situations not covered in the activity.

Ready to keep moving? Head on over to the net section for an overview of the Box Model and how it is used in CSS!

### 24:10 to 26:48 - Instructor Do: Box Model (Slides)

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above. Take notes of the box model and try to imagine how each property might affect the aesthetics of your HTML page.

Remember, in CSS, every element can be considered to fit within a series of boxes. Each box can be individually adjusted to provide spacing between elements or to fill in elements with colors. Those properties are: margin, border, and padding.

Having trouble visualizing it? Check out this image reference: [View the Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_boxmodel.asp).

Once ready, move on to the next section for a box model activity.

### 26:54 to 27:37 - Students Do: Box Model Activity

There is no activity folder this time around, all you need is your wits! 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get context on the activity. Then, pause the video and complete the activity as per the instructions on-screen.

Good luck!

### 27:44 to 30:59 - Instructor Do: Box Model Activity Review

So, how are your math skills after all? Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above, and compare your responses with the ones on-screen.

Ask yourself, how did you do? What are some key lessons about the relationship between border, padding, and margin in the box model?

In the next section, you will learn about in-line and block elements, and how you can arrange them by leveraging the skills you just learned!

### 31:05 to 46:34 - Instructor Do: We Be Floatin' Slides + Demo 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to learn about floating CSS elements. This is a bit of a longer section, so be sure to take note of questions that you’ll want to bring to office-hours.

Need a quick summary to keep up with it all? We got you covered:

  - Flow is the idea that every single element—text, images, links, sections, etc.—all take up a set amount of space on the screen. 
  - These elements, by default, won't stack on top of one another so instead they have to find ways to "flow" around one another. A big part of CSS is in managing how elements will fit into this “flow”.
  - There are two kinds of elements:
    - Block Elements: Take up entire lines.
    - Inline Elements: Can fit adjacently
  - Floating an element "forces" it to a side that you specify.
  - The clearfix hack be used to create alignment between two sections. This is more advanced, so please seek assistance if you are having a hard time with this concept. 

Once you think you’ve got it, come on over to the next activity and put your skills to the test.

### 46:41 to 47:49 - Groups Do: Float Activity 

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video.

When you are ready, open up `09-FloatLayout-Activity` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity.

Once done, unpause the video and watch the instructor recap to review the solution.

### 47:35 to 53:59 - Instructor Do: Review Float Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to see the solution as demoed by the instructor. Keep an ear out for student questions that may address different situations not covered in the activity.

Great work!

### 54:06 to 54:23 - BREAK

Pause the video and take a quick break. You've earned it!

### 54:29 to 01:15:22 - Instructor Do: CSS Positioning Slides + Demo

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to learn about positioning CSS elements. This is another long section that includes a demo. Be ready with your class activity files and follow along with the class.

To recap, here are the important points to remember:

  - Position types:
    - static: Default position.
    - relative: Positions elements relative to their static location in the document. 
    - absolute: Positions elements relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (non-static). 
    - fixed: Positions elements relative to the top left of the browser window. 
    - z-index: Allows us to position elements on top of one another.
    - display: none: Allows us to hide specific elements from the view. 

  - You can also review the [Video Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHfJn0jqBro&list=PLgJ8UgkiorClK-ZG5jYqbdgOD2DRHROkT&index=4) for a slower paced recap of these topics.

    - Using HTML/CSS, create the layout shown on the screen.
    - For reference, the colors used on the screen are #eee and #999.
    - You need to make this page scroll to see how the fixed position element behaves. Don't waste time writing copy! You can generate paragraphs of lorem ipsum text using http://www.lipsum.com/feed/html.
    - _HINT:_ Use the code from the last few activities to help get you started.

When done, check out the review in the next to section to see how you did.
