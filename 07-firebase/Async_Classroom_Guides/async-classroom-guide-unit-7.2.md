## Unit 7.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/sRI1_EdgTIo](https://youtu.be/sRI1_EdgTIo)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To introduce the utility of server-side storage systems like Firebase
    - To provide a grasp of the basic methods for storing and retrieving data in Firebase
    - To introduce the concept of user "presence" in Firebase
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 04:34 - Instructor Do: Welcome + Opening Questions

Welcome to class!

First of all, congratulations on completing nearly 2 months of an intense, high paced coding curriculum. We have  essentially completed the "front-end" aspect of the curriculum and that we will be diving deep into backend technologies starting today.

To start, watch the video as indicated above to listen to some students reflect on this progress. As you watch, ask yourself. What are some reflections of your own?

### 04:41 to 05:29 - Instructor Talk: Homework 7 Warning

Before we keep moving, watch the video as indicated to get some context on the upcoming homework. It will be a tough one, and many of today's lessons will be immediately relevant. None of this is necessarily "new". The challenge is in getting a handle on increasingly complex javascript logic.

Once you are through here, head over to the next section to warm-up with a student discussion on Client and Server side persistence.

### 05:35 to 09:56 - Everyone Talk: Discuss Client vs Server Persistence

This section should serve as a warm-up to get you thinking of the high-level concepts that we'll be working with today.

  - Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to listen to students discuss the following questions:
  - What is "data persistence"?
  - What is the difference between "client side" and "server side" data storage?
  - What is one case where you might use one vs the other?
  - What is one advantage of using each?

As you watch, try to find your own answers to these questions. Write them down. Could you explain this to someone who has little understanding of these technologies?

When you are through, head over to the next section for a brief introduction to Firebase.

### 10:02 to 12:32 - Instructor Talk: Firebase Introduction

You will need to navigate to [Firebase's Website](https://firebase.google.com/) to follow along with this activity.

Firebase offers an extremely easy to use system for relaying data between your application and their dedicated platforms. But, you don't have to read that here. Watch the video as indicated above to learn the basics of Firebase. 

Then, when you are through, head on over to the next section to start building your own application.

### 12:38 to 17:58 - Everyone Do: My First Firebase Database

Before restarting the video, ensure that you have a Google account. You will need one to use this service.

Once you are ready, unpause the video and follow along with the instructor to create your very first database using Firebase!

### 18:05 to 24:32 - Instructor Do: Ex 1 - Click Button Counter - Firebase Console

In this section, the instructor will demonstrate how to create a button that interacts with your Firebase database. In this case, a button that counts clicks. You can follow along with this example using `09-clickbutton` from your class activity files.

Watch the video as indicated above to learn this process. When you are done, continue on for further reflections on the kinds of functionalities that you could create with this database service.

### 24:38 to 33:31 - Everyone Do: Reflect on Firebase

Now that we have the completed code for a Firebase app, let's take a moment to reflect on what exactly is going on. Look through the code and try to describe it to yourself.

Then, watch the video as indicated above to listen to other students' reflections on the topic.

When you are through, get ready for an analysis activity that will help you better understand how this code works.-

### 33:37 to 34:07- Students Do: Re-comment Click Button Code

In this next section, we will use the Data Attributes to display data contained in JSON responses from the API.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity.

Then, open up the completed code in `10-clickbutton-complete` from your class activity files and add comments that explain explain each step along the way.

### 34:42 to 36:57 - Everyone Do: Review comments

Look for the file `instructor-do-clickbutton-fullcomments.html` in `10-clickbutton-complete` from your class activity files. 

First, review this on your own. Then, watch the video as indicated above to listen to other students' reflections.

### 37:04 to 47:59 - Everyone Do: ClickDown Counter 

Before going on break, let's add the opposite functionality to this app, count _down_ as you click.

Watch the video as indicated above. Follow along with the instructor's demo using `11-countdownbutton/` from your class activity files. 

Once you are through, try it out in your browser. Does it work? Do you understand _how_ it works?

If you'd like to review the solution with a slower pace, check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PHeP5bLqYE).

### 48:06 to 48:26 - BREAK!

Let's take a quick break before the next round of progress. 

Stretch your legs. Get some water. Self care is important.

### 48:32 to 54:38 - Instructor Do: Multiple Properties

With more complicated applications, you may need to store multiple properties. 

Watch the video as indicated above to learn how to set multiple properties into a single Firebase data object. Follow along with the instructor's demo using `12-moreproperties` from your class activity files. 

Once you are through, head over to the next section for another example; this time, using our application from our client-side data storage discussion.

### 54:45 to 01:08:15 - Everyone Do: Most Recent User

Let's put the lessons from the previous section into practice.

Watch the video as indicated above to learn how to set multiple properties into a single Firebase data object. Follow along with the instructor's demo using `13-mostrecentuser` from your class activity files.

If you'd like to review this code at a slower pace, check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWH19t4ujRA).

Once you are done, get ready for the big solo-activity of the day!

### 01:08:21 to 01:11:53 - Students Do: CoderBay Example

In this activity, you will put all of the lessons learned fo far into practice.

Watch the video as indicated above to get the instructor's context for this activity, including the expected functionality for your finished application

Then, follow the instructions in the readme.md found in `14-codersbay` from your class activity files. Keep in mind, this activity is expected to take around 30 minutes to complete. Pace yourself, and feel free to take quick breaks as needed. Sometimes we just need to step away for a bit before continuing!

When you are through, head over to the next activity to review the solution.

### 01:11:59 to 01:24:38 - Instructor Do: Review CoderBay Example

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

If you'd like to review this solution at a slower pace, check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpSjBZKnrN4).

In the final section, you'll learn about an extra cool feature available to you via Firebase, "Presence".

### 01:24:48 to 01:36:06 - Everyone Do: CoderBay Presence Example

This is the final section for the day.

Watch the video as indicated above to learn how count and display "Presence" on your website. What does that mean? You'll have to watch the video to find out. You can follow along with the instructor's demo using `16-codersbay-viewtracker` from your class activity files. 

Don't skip this section! It will help further solidify the day's lessons, and introduce some new possibilities for your future work!

### 01:36:12 to 01:37:15 - Next Topics + Class Ending

Class is over!

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above for a quick preview of upcoming topics. Remember: Take this week's homework seriously and _start early!_. The complexity of our code is increasing exponentially, and it might catch up to you sooner rather than later!

Happy coding!
