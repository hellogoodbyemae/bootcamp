## Unit 11.1 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/1OVSqx5zER4](https://youtu.be/1OVSqx5zER4)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To master the basics of JavaScript objects
    - To create basic JavaScript constructors for usage in Node applications
    - To create a simple Node application which uses methods contained within a constructed object
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 05:05 - Instructor Do: Welcome Class

Welcome to class!

In today's class, we will introduce constructors as a way to generate JavaScript objects dynamically and help keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Not sure what we mean by that? Watch the video as indicated above to hear the instructor's context on the purpose of constructors and the day's activities. When you are done, head over to the next section to hit the ground running with a couple of activities that will help illustrate the benefit of constructors.

### 05:12 to 06:26 - Students Do: Raining Cats and Dogs

To start, go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with the instructions below:

  - Make a dogs object with three keys...
    - First key called "raining" with a value of true
    - Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"
    - Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs
  - Make a cats object with three keys...
    - First key called "raining" with a value of false
    - Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"
    - Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats
  - Make the dog bark
  - Make the cat meow

If you have time, give the following a try as well:
  - _BONUS:_ Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the raining keys are equal to true.
  - _BONUS:_ Look to see if you can find any means to simplify your code further and further

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 06:33 to 24:48 - Students Do: Everyone Do: Raining Cats and Dogs Demo

Let's review our work!

Follow along with the video as indicated above, using the solution code found in `01-RainingCatsAndDogs-NoCon` from your class activity files. Favor the solution code in your class activity files, as the demonstration includes a few missteps that help illustrate common pitfalls by developers.

Then, move on to the next section to see how you could make your code much more efficient by leveraging constructors.

### 24:54 to 37:37 - Instructor Do: Cats and Dogs, Constructed Together!

In this section, you will watch the instructor redo the last activity using what's known as a constructor, that is essentially a function which can be called upon to create an object with a particular layout.

Watch the video as indicated above to see how this all works! Follow along using `02-RainingCatsAndDogs-Con` from your class activity files. As you watch, ask yourself, how can you further leverage constructors to make your code even more DRY?

In the next section, you'll get to try this for yourself!

### 37:43 to 39:28 - Groups Do: Character Creation 

Let's try using constructors in an activity.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `03-CharacterCreate` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 39:34 to 54:52 - Instructor Do: Review Character Creation + Building On Constructors

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. The instructor also takes some time to expand on constructors and how you can leverage it to create more complex functionalities.

If you'd like to watch a more detailed, slower paced explanation, check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_Qi4yg8jQg).

Remember that you have the solution code available to you to review your work, or if you need some nudging along. This is also a good time to stop and google any concepts that you are not 100% understanding. Should you need it, check out [MDN's documentation on constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor).

When you are done, get ready for a quick break.

### 54:59 to 55:10 - BREAK! 

We've covered a lot today. Let's take a quick 15 minute break!

### 55:17 to 01:25:06 - Instructor Do: Prototypes

The following section is a little bit longer, and includes an explanation of an additional concept known as prototypes. Because this section is optional, it is possible that your own class did not cover it. It's still useful information, and we encourage you to cover this as well.

Watch the video as indicated above, then get ready for the final activity of the day, where you'll get to create a Tamagotchi!

### 01:25:13 to 01:28:40 - Groups Do: Tamagotchi Time

Let's flex our knowledge of constructors.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `04-Tamagotchi` from your class activity files. Keep in mind, this is a _highly complex_ activity. Take your time, and be sure to follow through on the complete functionality described in the readme.md

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 01:28:46 to 01:29:57 - Everyone Do: Tamagotchi Summary + Class Close

The class that you are watching did not have time to review this activity completely. That does not mean that you cannot validate your completed app, though!

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to listen to the instructor's context for the review, then compare your work with the solution code found in your class activity files. How did you do? Do you have questions for office hours?

After that, class is done! Be sure to reach out to your instructional staff for any information related to upcoming homework.

Happy coding!
