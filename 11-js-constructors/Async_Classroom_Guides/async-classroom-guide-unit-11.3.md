## Unit 11.3 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/IfYnwSZhSrA ](https://youtu.be/IfYnwSZhSrA)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To sketch the design of their applications before starting to code;
    - To use constructors to create objects
    - To explain callbacks and closures.
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 04:52 - Class Welcome

Welcome to class! 

To start, watch the video as indicated for a recap on constructors. Then, pause the video when told to do so and head over to the next section for a warm-up activity.

### 04:58 to 08:30 - Instructor Do: Demonstrate Application

We're going to hit the ground running with a demo of the application that we will be building throughout the day.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above. As you watch this demo, ask yourself: How is the application able to search for specific actors and actresses?

Be sure to take notes, as you'll be sketching out the architecture in the next section.

### 08:37 to 09:08 - Groups Do: Sketch Architecture

Let's get started on this application.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to listen to the instructor's context on the goals of this first activity. Then, follow along with the instructions using the readme.md found in `11-Stu_Architecture` from your class activity files.

Complete the activity as instructed, then move on to the next section to review your work.

### 09:15 to 13:09 - Instructor Do: Review Sketch Architecture Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution in your class activity files.

Before moving on to the next section, be sure to clear any lingering doubts that you might have about the app's architecture. In the next section, you'll be implementing it yourself.

### 13:15 to 16:17 - Groups Do: Implement CLI

Let's implement the Command Line Interface for this application.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `12-Stu_Cli` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 16:24 to 20:34 - Instructor Do: Review Implement CLI Activity 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

In the next few sections, you will start to implement the various functionalities of the application.

### 20:40 to 24:08 - Groups Do: Implement Find Show

Now, let's take this a step further and implement the "find show" function.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `13-Stu_FindShow` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work.

### 24:14 to 33:02 - Instructor Do: Review Implement Find Show Activity 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

We are almost done with the complete application. How are you doing so far? Be sure to take a moment to research the answers to any lingering doubts you might have.

### 33:09 to 34:02 - Groups Do: Implement Find Actor

The last step is to implement the "find actor" function.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `13-Stu_FindActor` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work.

### 34:09 to 38:10 - Instructor Do: Review Implement Find Actor Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

In the last section before break, we will do a recap of the complete application.

### 38:17 to 50:45 - Everyone Do: Application Review

Watch the video as indicated to review the complete application with the rest of class. As you watch, ask yourself: What are some of the benefits of planning an architecture before writing any code?

As you plan applications of your own, you'll find that taking the time to sketch your architecture will often save you many hours of headaches.

### 50:45 to 50:51 - BREAK!

This is a good stopping point for now.

Take 15 minutes to stretch your legs and rest your eyes!

When we return, we will put this all together in a more complex activity.

### 50:51 to 01:00:01 - Instructor Do: Callbacks 

We have one more activity for the day. Before that, however, you should watch the following explanation of the relationship between callbacks and functions that receive them as arguments.

Watch the video as indicated above to view a demo of these activities. 

This may seem confusing now. But, remember, callbacks are simply functions passed as arguments to other functions. We've actually used callbacks extensively with jQuery. For example, every time we've used event listeners, as well as when we called on the `fs` package.

### 01:00:07 to 01:02:02 - Students Do: Callbacks Activity 

Let's put our knowledge of callbacks into practice.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `15-Callbacks` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work and close out today's class.

### 01:02:09 to 01:27:53 - Instructor Do: Review Callbacks Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

Once you are through, class is over. Great work. Be sure to bring any lingering questions to office-hours.

Happy coding!
