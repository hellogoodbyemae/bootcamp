## Unit 11.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/r0ExpYr3Mjo](https://youtu.be/r0ExpYr3Mjo)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To feel 100% comfortable using javascript constructors
    - To create simple applications that take in user input and utilize a constructor so as to create objects
    - To understand the basics of recursion and to learn how this process can be used to loop through a series of prompts multiple times
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 01:36 - Students Do: Constructing Programmers 

Welcome to class!

We're going to hit the ground running with a warm-up on constructors.

First, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to listen to the instructor's context on today's objectives.

Then, follow along with the warm-up activity instructions using the readme.md found in `05-Programmers` from your class activity files.

Complete the activity as instructed, then move on to the next section to review your work.

### 01:42 to 04:55 - Everyone Do: Constructing Programmers Summary

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

If you'd like to watch a more detailed, slower paced explanation, check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ph519qG6b9Q).

When you are ready, restart the video to take a deeper dive into constructors.

### 05:02 to 06:24 - Instructor Do: Input + Constructors = Less Work Overall

In this section, the instructor gives more context and examples on the benefits of applying constructors to help keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above, and follow along with the demo using the code found in `06-ProgrammersWithPrompt` from your class activity files.

Once you are through, get ready for an activity to put these skills to the test.

### 06:30 to 08:33 - Students Do: Input + Constructors activity

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `07-ProgrammersLoop` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 08:39 to 25:45 - Everyone Do: Making Multiples With Recursion

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

When you are through, get ready for a break!

### 25:46 to 25:51 - BREAK!

This is a good stopping point for now.

Take 15 minutes to stretch your legs and rest your eyes!

When we return, we will put this all together in a more complex activity.

### 25:51 to 31:04 - Groups Do: Team Manager

This is the big activity for the day!

Because of the complexity of this application, we will divide the coding work into two parts. This way, you can remain focused on the right priorities. Then, you will watch a review of the complete application.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear the context for this activity. You can follow along with the instructions using the readme.md found in `08-TeamManager` from your class activity files. 

Remember, we are working on part 1 first. Pace yourself. To set expectations, this is expected to take up to 60 minutes to complete. 

When you've got it working, head over to the next section to finish out the application.

### 31:11 to 32:03 - Groups Do: Team Manager Cont.

How are you doing so far?

Take a moment to listen to the instructor's context for the next set of objectives. Then, continue working on your application until you finish it.

Stuck? It's okay to take a peek at the solution code at this point. It should be in your class activity files. However, make sure that you don't use it as a crutch to simply finish the application. It will be a disservice to your own learning if you just copy what you see there.

When you are done, head over to the next activity for a complete review of this application.

### 32:09 to 56:59 - Everyone Do: Team Manager Summary

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

When you are ready, get ready for a break!

### 57:06 to 01:08:32 - Instructor Do: Constructors Within Constructors

In this section, you will get the opportunity to watch a demo of a movie manager application that uses constructors within constructors.

Watch the video as indicated above. Follow along with the demo using the files found in `09-MovieManager` from your class activity files.

After this, move on to the final section to close out today's class.

### 01:08:39 to 01:09:16 - Students Do: Filling Up Classrooms + Class End

There is one final activity that the class in the video did not have time to complete. That does not mean that you shouldn't!

Watch the video as indicated above top hear the instructor's context on this activity. Then, pause the video and check out the instructions found in the readme.md in `10-Classrooms` from your class activity files.

After you complete the activity, check out the solution code to review your work. How did you do? Do you have questions for office-hours?

Happy coding!
