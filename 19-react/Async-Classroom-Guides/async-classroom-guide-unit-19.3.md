## Unit 19.3 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/ps1UV22MvBs](https://youtu.be/ps1UV22MvBs)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To deepen understanding of passing props between React components.
    - To gain a firm understanding of the concept of child-parent relationships in React
    - To be able to programmatically render components from an array of data.
    - To introduce the concept of class components and component state.
    - To complete the Mongo Checkpoint.
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 13:31 - Instructor Do: Go Through Slides 

Welcome to Class!

We are going to start with a brief presentation on React Props. Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to follow along with the rest of class. Be sure to take notes, and feel free to pause the video to research any topics that you want to further clarify.

### 13:37 to 28:03 - Instructor Do: Props Demo 

As yourself, if a component is a function that returns some data, what else might a component be able to do? In this section, we will learn to pass arguments into React components through props.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to follow along with the rest of class. Be sure to code along with the demonstration. You will need the practice for the next student activity.

### 28:10 to 30:04 - Groups Do: Calculator Props

In this activity you will write a component that accepts props, performs arithmetic and renders the result.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructions for this activity. You will find the instructions in `24-Stu_PropsCalculator` from your class activity files. 

### 30:11 to 35:58 - Instructor Do: Review Calculator Props

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity with the rest of class. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

### 36:05 to 40:32 - Groups Do: Props Review 

In this activity you will make an existing React application more DRY through the use of reusable components and props.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructions for this activity. You will find the instructions in `25-Stu_PropsReview` from your class activity files.

When you are done, unpause the video to review the solution!

### 40:38 to 48:51 - Instructor Do: Review Props Review

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity with the rest of class. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

Before moving on, take note that, though the code is more DRY than it was, we're still manually rendering a FriendCard for each piece of data — we'll come back and solve this problem in a later activity!

### 48:57 to 51:56 - Students Do: Component Map

In this activity, you will utilize the map method in order to render JSX from an array of objects.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructions for this activity. You will find the instructions in `26-Stu_ComponentMap` from your class activity files.

When you are done, unpause the video to review the solution!

### 52:03 to 01:03:28 - Instructor Do: Review Component Map

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity with the rest of class. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

Keep in mind, the most important takeaway from this activity is that we can use the map method to loop over an array and return a new array of elements inside of JSX curly braces. React will then render each element in the resulting array.

In the next section, we will introduce the concept of state.

### 01:03:34 to 01:16:52 - Instructor Do: Introduce Stateful Components

The components that we've been working with so far are known as stateless, functional components. These components can render JSX, receive props, and embed JavaScript expressions inside of themselves. In a real application, we'd want to give some of our components more complex dynamic behaviors.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to follow along with an introduction to stateful components. Be sure to code along with the demonstration. You will need the practice for the next student activity.

Before moving on, make sure that you understand the following:
  - We can use state to associate data with our components and keep track of any values we want to update the UI when changed.
  - We can define methods on a class component and pass them as props.
  - The onClick prop can be used to set a click event listener to an element.

Then, get ready to to put these concepts into practice!

### 01:16:59 to 01:20:15 - Groups Do: Decrement Counter

In this activity you will add a "Decrement" button and event handler to the previous Click Counter example.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructions for this activity. You will find the instructions in `28-Stu_DecrementCounter` from your class activity files.

When you are done, unpause the video to review the solution!

### 01:20:21 to 01:29:34 - Instructor Do: Review Decrement Counter

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity with the rest of class. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

Then, get ready for a break, before getting a bit more practice with these kinds of components.

### 01:29:34 to 01:29:41 - BREAK!

We've covered a lot today and this is a good stopping point. 

Let's take a quick 15 minute break before continuing.

### 01:29:41 to 01:34:02 - Groups Do: Friend Refactor 

In this activity you will further refactor the Friends List application from earlier to use class components, events, and programmatically render the `FriendCard` components.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructions for this activity. You will find the instructions in `29-Stu_FriendRefactor` from your class activity files.

### 01:34:08 to 01:49:05 - Instructor Do: Review Friend Refactor

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity with the rest of class. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

When you are through, get ready for the final lesson of the day, using Forms in React.

### 01:49:12 to 01:58:13 - Instructor Do: Demonstrate Forms 

In this example we will demonstrate how to handle simple forms with React.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to follow along with an introduction to Forms in react. Be sure to code along with the demonstration. You will need the practice for the next student activity.

### 01:58:20 to 02:00:18 - Students Do: Fun With Forms 

In this activity you will add some new functionality to the previous form example.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructions for this activity. You will find the instructions in `31-Stu_FunWithForms` from your class activity files.

### 02:00:24 to 02:14:02 - Class End

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity with the rest of class. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

After that, class is over. Be sure to bring any lingering questions to office-hours.

Happy coding!
