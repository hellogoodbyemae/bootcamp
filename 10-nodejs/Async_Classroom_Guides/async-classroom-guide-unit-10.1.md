## Unit 10.1 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/tqe1UjezeMU](https://youtu.be/tqe1UjezeMU)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    -  To formally introduce the concept of servers, web-clients, requests and responses.
    - To demonstrate the basic process for running Node applications.
    - To introduce the syntax for capturing command line arguments and modularizing JavaScript in Node.
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 03:21 - Instructor Do: Project Week Feedback 

Welcome to class!

The first few minutes of today's class is focused on giving feedback on on your class projects. Please check-in with your group or your instructional staff to follow-up!

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear some general tips and next steps from your project!

After that, move over to the next section for an introduction into backend development.

### 03:28 to 13:50 - Instructor Do: The Mystery of Backend

So far, we have covered mostly frontend develppment, with some examples on leveraging APIs to exemplify backend capabilities.

In this section, you will review some slides with a  brief overview of backend technologies, and how they apply to our focus on the MERN tech stack.

When you are done here, head on over to the next section for an introduction to today's primary topic: Node.js.

### 13:57 to 28:16 - Instructor Do: Intro to Node.js

Have you ever heard of node.js?

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear the instructor's introduction to node.js.

This information will be _critical_ going forward. So, take notes! And feel free to pause the video as needed to research any concepts that you'd like further clarification one.

In particular, pay attention (and research) to the definitions of _synchronous_ and _asynchronous_ threading. As you watch this, ask yourself:
  - What is the benefit of asynchronous threading?
  - How does node.js allow for this to take place?

In the next section, you'll be confirming that you have node properly installed on your machine.

### 28:22 to 29:47 - Everyone Do: Quick Node Check

Ready to get started with node,js?

Watch the video as indicated above to confirm that you have installed node correctly. 

Should you run into any technical issues that you cannot resolve, reach out to a TA or attend office-hours ASAP.

After this, head over to the next section for a node.js demo!

### 29:54 to 32:13 - Instructor Do: Hello.js Demo

Pay attention to the demo in this section, as you'll be replicating something similar in an upcoming activity.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to watch a demo on creating and running a node.js file.

Afterwards, try to run the file yourself. It should be in `01-HelloNode` from your class activity files.

### 32:20 to 33:26 - Students Do: Sriracha.js Activity

In this section, you will create a node.js file that you can run yourself!

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `02-Siracha` from your class activity files.

When you are done, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 33:32 to 34:24 - Instructor Do: Review Sriracha.js Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity.

How did you do? Are you able to understand how node files are executed from the terminal?

### 34:30 to 37:37 - Instructor Do: Arguments.js Demo

In this section, the instructor will demo how arguments (`args`) are stored in node.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to understand how you can leverage `process.argv` to store arguments in an array.

When you are done, head over to the next section to expand on this by adding arguments together.

### 37:44 to 40:25 - Instructor Do: Arguments.js Addition Demo

In this section, the instructor will showcase how to create some functionality using arguments in node.

You can follow along using `04-ArgumentsAddition` from your class activity files.

Watch the video as indicated above, then move on to the next section to try it out yourself!

### 40:31 to 46:06 - Groups Do: Parameter Check Activity

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity.

Then, follow these instructions:
- Create a command line node application that takes in two parameters and outputs whether they are equal or not.
- _HINT:_ Start by simply logging the value of each argument to console. Then use your usual JavaScript approach (recall that Node is still just JavaScript).

When you are done, get ready for a break!

### 46:12 to 46:42 - BREAK!

We've covered a lot today. Let's take a quick 15 minute break!

### 46:49 to 49:58 - Groups Do: Calculator.js Activity 

Let's take our understanding of node one step further by creating some more nuanced functionality.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `06-Calculator` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!
 
### 50:04 to 01:03:41 - Instructor Do: Review Calculator.js

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity.

If you'd still like a slower paced review of this activity, check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JH28RCouqfw )

**BONUS**
If you want an extra challenge, take the time to complete the activity found in `07-Multiples` from your class activity files.

Remember that you have the solution code available to you to review your work, or if you need some nudging along.

### 01:03:47 to 01:17:59 -  Instructor Do: Modularization Using Require/Exports

In this section, the instructor will demo a concept called "Modularization" in node by requiring individual applications to import or export other files as required.

Sound confusing? Don't worry! Watch the video as indicated above and it will all make sense in no time. You can follow along with the demo using `08-Modularization` from your class activity files.

Then, when you are done, head over to the final activity of the day to give it a shot yourself!

### 01:18:05 to 01:21:12 - Groups Do: Bands.js Activity

Let's put modularization into practice.

Go to the timestamp indicated above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `09-Bands` from your class activity files.

When you have finished the activity, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work and close out the class!

### 01:21:18 to 01:24:05 - Instructor Do: Review Bands.js

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

After that, class is over!

Like we said, be sure to check in with your Project I group and instructional staff for any additional feedback and next steps.

Happy coding!
