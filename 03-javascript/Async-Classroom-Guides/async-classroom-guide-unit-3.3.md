## Unit 3.3 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/y0joRZ7dJAQ](https://youtu.be/y0joRZ7dJAQ)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To gain an understanding of JavaScript Functions and Objects.
    - To begin utilizing the basic JavaScript learned so far to build simple JavaScript games.
  - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 01:38 - Welcome + Today's class 

Make sure that you are comfortable and ready for class. 

To start, watch the video through the timestamps above, and review the day's objectives one more time:

  - To gain an understanding of JavaScript Functions and Objects.
  - To begin utilizing the basic JavaScript learned so far to build simple JavaScript games.

Keep in mind, we are continually updating the content based on student feedback, so the objectives show on-screen may not 100% match what's written here. The high-level goals remain the same, though, so focus on the core message: Today we will learn about For Loops, JavaScript Functions, and Objects. With these two tools, you'll start making your first functional JS applications!

Once you are ready, hop on over to the next section for an activity on array building.

### 01:44 to 02:55 - Groups Do: Array Building

It's time for a warm-up activity. 

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `25-LoopTV` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your responses.

### 03:01 to 09:27 - Instructor Do: Review Array Building 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Keep an ear out for student questions that may further clarify these concepts.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for a two-part lesson on using Functions.

### 09:33 to 12:15 -  Instructor Do: Logging - No Functions

Remember, arrays are foundational to the rest of this course, so we have to keep practicing with them. 

Next watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to to review a scenario where we may want to find ways to keep our code Dry (Don't Repeat Yourself). They key point to remember is that the code we will show is extremely repetitive and is kind of bulky as a result. 

Follow along using your class activity files in `26-SuperheroLogging`. As you work through this, ask yourself: How might Functions help us mitigate this problem?

Once you are done, move on to the next section to get the flip-side: Using Functions to keep things simple.

### 12:21 to 24:15 -  Instructor Do: Logging - With Functions 

Now that we have the context of a scenario where not using Functions creates repetitive code, let's look at one where Functions help us keep things DRY.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review how you can reduce the number of For Loops to just one, using a Function.

Once you are done, get ready to test your knowledge in an Functions activity.

### 24:23 to 24:15 -  Groups Do: My First Functions

Let's test your understanding of Functions. 

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `27-MyFirstFunctions/` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your responses.

### 25:30 to 41:42 - Instructor Do: Review My First Functions

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Keep an ear out for student questions that may further clarify these concepts. 

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for another two-part lesson that contrasts the practical uses of arrays versus objects.

### 41:49 to 47:20 - Instructor Do: Good Array

Alright! Let's follow-up on that with a quick lesson on looping through a set of numbers using an array.

Go to the timestamp above and follow along using your class activity files found in `28-GoodArray/`, from your class activity files. The key point to remember is that this is an example of a situation in which using an array is a _good_ idea.

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to contrast this scenario with one in which using an object might be a better idea.

### 47:27 to 50:27 -  Instructor Do: Joan of Arc (Bad Arrays)

This next bit is meant to represent an example of the limitations of arrays; namely, that they are not useful for describing associations across arrays.

Go to the timestamp above and follow along using your class activity files found in `29-JoanOfArcArrays`, from your class activity files. The key point to remember is that this is an example of a situation in which using an object helps mitigate the problem of data association across arrays.

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to take a deeper dive into these concepts.

### 50:34 to 01:01:55 - Instructor Do: Gandalf The Grey Objects

This next section is _critical_ to your growth as a developer, so be ready to take lots of notes! Seriously, this is the kind of material that should prompt office-hours questions.

Go to the timestamps indicated above and follow along using the class activity files found in `30-GandalfTheGreyObjects`. As you do so, ask yourself: Why would we need to use bracket notation over dot notation?

Think you've got it? Let's recap the main 

### 01:02:02 to 01:03:23 - Instructor Do: Gandalf The Grey Slides

Let's take a breather and recap the main takeaways in a brief slideshow. Review your notes and keep an ear out for student questions that may help further clarify these concepts.

When you are ready, head over tot he next section for an activity on objects, before we take a break.

### 01:03:29 to 01:03:40 - Groups Do: Basic Objects 

You're not imagining things. Due to a technical issue, this section is simply a screencap of the instructions from the slideshow.

Still, use your class activity files from `31-MyFirstObject/` to get context. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. You can do it!

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your responses.

### 01:03:47 to 01:04:27 - BREAK!

Take a break. You've earned it!

Get ready. When we come back, we'll get a bit more practice with For Loops, and then we will close out with a lesson on scope and callbacks.

### 01:04:33 to 01:13:18 - Instructor Do: Review Basic Objects

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Keep an ear out for student questions that may further clarify these concepts. Remember, these concepts are _critical_, so rewind and watch again if you need it.

Finally, if you would like to review a slower paced explanation, check out the [activity review](https://youtu.be/jtU6YrNPv7E)!

When you are ready, head on over to the final section for an activity on scope and callbacks.

### 01:13:24 to 01:18:19 - Everyone Do: Scope & Callbacks

Let's test your understanding of Functions. 

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. This one in particular is a bit long, as the instructor will try to set you up for success once the activity starts. You can follow along with the explanation in `27-MyFirstFunctions/` from your class activity files. Be sure to take notes!

In case you need it, here is a summary of the main points covered:

  - JavaScript has rules for where we can use the variables we define.
    - There are some variables we can see everywhere. These are called global variables.
    - Variables we define inside of <script> tags are global.
    - Variables inside of functions are only visible inside of the function body.
    - Variables outside of the function are still visible.
  - This concept is called scope.
  - A system like this helps ensure that the names we use always refer to what we want them to refer to.

When you are ready, follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. Then, head on over to the last review, and then we're done!

### 01:18:25 to 01:32:26 - Instructor Do: Review Scope & Callbacks + Close

Get ready, this review is a bit lengthy, and it is overflowing with information. Again, this should prompt office-hours questions, so bring your notes and rewatch this explanation as many times as you need to

And that's it. Be seeing you at office hours.

Happy coding!
