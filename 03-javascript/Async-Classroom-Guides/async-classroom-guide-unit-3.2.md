## Unit 3.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/598KIxWRJqE](https://youtu.be/598KIxWRJqE)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To understand the use and syntax of JavaScript's for loops.
    - To use for loops, arrays, and conditional logic to create a rock-paper-scissors game.
  - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 02:52 - Welcome + Today's class 

Make sure that you are comfortable at your desk. This class is _loaded_ with activities, and is much more active than previous classes so far. Don't worry, though. We're here to help you every step of the way.

To start, watch the video through the timestamps above, and review the day's objectives one more time:

  - To understand the use and syntax of JavaScript's for loops.
  - To use for loops, arrays, and conditional logic to create a rock-paper-scissors game.

Keep in mind, we are continually updating the content based on student feedback, so the objectives show on-screen may not match what's written here. The high-level goals remain the same, though, so focus on the core message: Today we will learn about For Loops to expand our knowledge of JavaScript.

Once you are ready, hop on over to the next section for a quick recap of the week's lessons so far.

### 02:59 to 14:37 - Instructor Do: Basic Recap

Like we said, this is a recap of recent lessons in JavaScript. Give it watch, and be sure to take notes! You may think you already know this, but actively thinking about it once more will help solidify it in your mind.

When you are done, move on to the next section for a warm-up activity.

### 32:18 to 34:52 - Instructor Do: For Loops

Great work! These lessons will set the foundations for us to leverage arrays to manage our data. You may have noticed, unfortunately, that now you are writing a lot of repetitive lines of code. This goes against the principle of keeping your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to learn about For Loops, and how they can help you mitigate this problem.

Once you are done, get ready to test your knowledge in a code dissection activity.

### 34:59 to 35:06 - Students Do: For Loop Dissection

Go to the timestamp above and read the instructions on-screen. The video may appear a bit strange. Due to a technical issue, we are relying on a still image for context setting. 

Please review `17-MyFirstLoop` from your class activity files and follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. If you feel stuck or have any questions, feel free to head over to the following review to get any clarifications.

When you are done, it's time for a break!

### 01:02:51 to 01:03:32 -  BREAK

Take a break. You've earned it!

Get ready. When we come back, we'll get a bit more practice with For Loops, and then we will build a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

### 01:03:38 to 01:06:51 -  Students Do: Another Loop

Welcome back! Let's hit the ground running with one more practice exercise to solidify our understanding of For Loops.

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `19-AnotherLoop` from your class activity files. As mentioned in the video, the solution is pretty much already provided to you. However, our goal here is to understand _how_ it works. 

_Hint:_ Keep an eye out for mentions of the `charAt()` method. It's the key to understanding this activity.

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your responses.

### 01:06:57 to 01:11:40 -  Instructor Do: Review Another Loop

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Be sure to follow along with the solution code provided in your activity files.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for a demo on Browser Events.

### 01:11:47 to 01:23:39 -  Instructor Do: Demo Browser Events

Let's take a step back and look at key unction of JavaScript: Browser Events.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above for a demo on how to trigger Brower Events. You can follow along with `21-Events` from your class activity files. 

If you need it, here is a brief outline of topics covered:

  - On User Input:
    - We can "hook onto" the event of a user pressing and releasing a key by referring to document.onkeyup.
    - Setting document.onkeyup equal to a function tells JavaScript to execute that function whenever the event occurs.

  - On retrieving data from the DOM:
    - We can get our hands on an element on the page that has an ID by using document.getElementById.
      - This always returns a single element.
    - This gives us access to what is called a DOM node.
      - A DOM node is a browser's way of representing an HTML element on the page.
      - Unlike the code in an HTML document, this DOM node can be modified "live" by our JavaScript.

Still have questions? Bring them to office-hours! These topics are crucial to your learning.

Once ready, move on to the next section for a demo on our final activity for the day: The Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

### 01:23:46 to 01:26:35 -  Instructor Do: Demo RPS

This is a quick demo on the Rock, Paper, Scissors game. Follow along with `23-RPS-Coded` from your class activity files.

As you watch, note the following important points:

  - You will need to use conditional statements and the &&/|| operators to make things work.
  - It's okay if you have to write a long chain of if/else if/else statements. If you find yourself doing this, you're on the right track!

Ready to try it yourself? Give it a shot in the next activity!

### 01:26:42 to 01:29:18 -  Students Do: Pseudocode RPS

The first step in coding something this complex should always be to Pseudocode it. This will help you think through the complete logic of your code.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above, then review the instructions below:

  - Spend a few moments outlining all the steps and conditions that go into a single game of rock paper scissors.
  - Try to break it down into steps that you could code out.
  - Think of basic elements like loops, if-else statements, arrays, alerts, etc.

Once you think you've got it, head on over to the next section to review the solution.

### 01:29:24 to 01:33:50 -  Instructor Do: Review Pseudocode RPS
