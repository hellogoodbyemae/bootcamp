## Unit 3.1 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/FiG5z063LI8](https://youtu.be/FiG5z063LI8)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To gain a preliminary grasp of JavaScript definitions and of basic syntax.
    - To utilize variables, logging, arrays, and if/else statements to create simple JavaScript applications.
  - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 03:27 - Welcome + Admin Items

Get ready. This class hits the ground running. This first section deals with some follow-ups to last class. In particular [Bootswatch Styling](https://bootswatch.com/), which is a site where you can find bootstrap templates that may help you further polish the presentation of your websites.

Once you are ready, hop on over to the next section for a quick overview of today's class objectives.

### 03:34 to 05:03 - Today's Class

Now that we are caught up on admin items, take a look at today's class objectives by watching the video through the timestamps above. As quick reminder, the focus will be on: 

  - Gaining a preliminary grasp of JavaScript definitions and of basic syntax.
  - Utilizing variables, logging, arrays, and if/else statements to create simple JavaScript.

Keep in mind that the slides on screen may not 100% match what's written here. Favor the content in this guide. It has been updated for clarity.

Once ready, move on to the next section for some tips for JavaScript learners.

### 05:10 to 09:44 - Instructor Do: How to Learn JavaScript

JavaScript can be a _lot_ for some. Be patient! Once it clicks, it'll be second nature to you. Watch the video through the timestamps above to get some tips on how you might ease your way into this difficult topic.

Take notes, keep organized, and head on over to the next section for a quick activity that will help you start reading JS code in no time.

### 09:50 to 16:33 - Students Do: Code Dissection

It's time for a warm-up activity. 

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. As you do so, listen for other students' responses to the instructor's questions. You can follow along with `01-CodeDissection` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once done, take a moment to pause the video and reflect on what you've just learned. Still have questions? Be sure to bring them to office hours.

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to take a deeper dive into the history and functionality of JavaScript.

### 16:39 to 18:35 - Instructor Do: What is JavaScript

It's important that we understand a bit of the history of the development tools that we use. This gives us context as to _how_ and _why_ things are built in a specific way.

Watch the video through the timestamps above to get more familiar with the language of JavaScript.

To recap, JavaScript is the third of the three fundamental programming languages of the modern web (along with HTML and CSS). It allows developers to create _dynamic_ web applications capable of taking in user inputs, changing what users can see, animating elements, and much more.

When ready, continue on to the next section to take a deep dive into JavaScript variables.

### 18:41 to 23:46 - Instructor Do: Variables Slides + Demo 

Variables are the nouns of programing. To programming languages, they are "things". Watch the video through the timestamps above to learn more about their use in the language of JavaScript. There is an accompanying demo in this section, so be ready with your notes to follow along.

If this is a bit confusing for you, try to use the example inside `02-BasicVariablesDemo` from your class activity files to better follow the instructor's comments.

Sounds interesting, right? Ready to try it? Head on over to the next activity to give it a shot!

### 23:52 to 24:35 - Students Do: Variable Activity 

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `03-PizzaVariables` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once done, unpause the video and go to the next activity for a review.

### 24:42 to 26:59 - Instructor Do: Review Variable Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to see how other students handled this activity.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for another demo and set of student activities that take these concepts further.

### 27:05 to 31:17 - Instructor Do: Console Log Demo

This is section includes a demo for which you will need to use Google Inspector. Watch the video through the timestamps above to learn about the console.log function, and how it may help you debug your code.

Feel free to watch this demo a number of times if you need to. Otherwise, head keep going to the next section to learn about Coding Grids.

### 31:23 to 33:29 - Instructor Do: Console Log Slides

This is a continuation of the previous section. Watch the video through the timestamps above and take notes!

Remember, these are _critical_ skills for developers. Here are some important talking points to help you along:

  - Console.log is a function that prints a message and that "lives" in the JavaScript engine.

  - We can often give functions "things to work with." In this case, we give console.log a message to print.

  - Student will write their own functions, which they'll use the same way.

Now it'¡s time to put your skills to the test. The next section is an activity. Ready? Let's get to it!

### 33:35 to 34:29 - Students Do: Console Log Activity

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `05-PizzaConsole` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once done, unpause the video and go to the next activity for a review.

### 34:36 to 37:00  - Instructor Do: Review Console.log Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution. Be sure to follow along with the solution code provided in your activity files.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for one more demo and set of student activities, before we go on break.

### 37:06 to 39:26 - Instructor Do: Alerts, Prompts, Confirms Demo + Slides

This section builds on the concepts from console.log and shows you some additional tools that may help you communicate content to your users; enter, Alerts, Prompts, and Confirms!

Watch the video through the timestamps above to learn about ways that you can use these pop-up box type functionalities to further improve your web pages.

When ready, move on to the next section for an activity on these topics.

### 39:32 to 40:11 - Groups Do: Alert Activity

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `07-PromptSushi` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once done, unpause the video and go to the next activity for a review.

### 40:17 to 42:23 - Instructor Do: Review Alert Activity 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to see how other students handled this activity. Be sure to follow along with the solution code provided in your activity files.

When you are ready, head on over to the last section before we go on break.

### 42:29 to 44:49 - Instructor Do: Document.write 

Document.write helps you write directly into the HTML page. It's pretty cool, but it is used less so nowadays. Rather, it is important to learn that how it works, as similar functions will become relevant once we hit more advanced JavaScript.

Watch the video through the timestamps above to learn about this functionality, and you might use it in your work. Then, when you are done, you're good to go on break!

### 44:49 to 44:56 - BREAK

Time for a break!

Pause the video, stretch your legs, and take some time to reflect on what we’ve learned so far.

### 44:56 to 49:22 - Instructor Demo: If/Else Statement 

We hope you are rested, because this final stretch covers another crucial functionality of JavaScript. 

Watch the video through the timestamps above, and try to follow along using `08-ConditionalDemo`from your class activity files. This will be followed up by a student activity to see how well you did with these topics.

Consider this an introduction to conditional statements (again, very important to our learning), and _take lots of notes!_

### 49:29 to 50:54 - Groups Do: If/Else Activity #1

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity, until you reach a card instructing you to pause the video. 

There are no class activity files. Instead, follow these instructions:

 - Create a website (from scratch) that asks users if they eat steak.

 - If they respond with "yes", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Steak Sandwich!"

 - If they respond with "no", write the following to the page: "Here’s a Tofu Stir-Fry!"

 - Bonus: Ask what the user’s birth year is. If they are under 21, alert the following: "No Sake for you!"

 - Hint: You will need to use document.write() from a few slides back.

Alright, let's get started!

### 51:00 to 57:49 - Instructor Do: Review If/Else Activity #1

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to see how other students handled this activity. Be sure to follow along with the solution code provided in your activity files.

If you need a slower paced version, check out the [activity guide](https://youtu.be/rlhhRVO5EOg).

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for another demo and set of student activities.

### 57:55 to 01:03:58 -  Arrays Slides + Demo

This is the final stretch! This section covers arrays, which are like "lists" or "collections of variables. Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above, and follow along with a demo on how to use arrays.

Remember, each variable in an array has an index number. The first variable in an array is index 0, and it goes up from there. It's pretty simple, but this small detail can really trip you up sometimes.

The final section is

### 01:04:04 to 01:15:54 - Everyone Do: Class Code Dissection + Class Closing

You'll find that the video ends sort of abruptly. This is due to an irrelevant discussion regarding homework that dominated the recorded class that we pulled this Async Classroom Guide from. Either way, this is the last section!

Watch the video through to the end to dissect some code that includes arrays. Treat this as practice and be sure to jot down any questions that you might want to bring to office hours.
