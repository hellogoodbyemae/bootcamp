## Unit 13.1 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/IKF0K7bH0sE](https://youtu.be/IKF0K7bH0sE)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To create a real-world application for handling reservations using Node/Express
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 04:30 - Instructor Do: Welcome + Demo Application

Welcome students to class!

Today we will build out our first complete fullstack application from scratch! The class will be divided into five phases. But first, let's take some time to review the application.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get the instructor's contet on the day's activities. You will need the these resources to follow along:

  - [Use expressjs to get url and post parameters](https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-expressjs-to-get-url-and-post-parameters)

  - [Build a restful api using node and express 4](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-restful-api-using-node-and-express-4)
  
  - [Hot Restaurant App](hot-restaurant.herokuapp.com.)

Take your time going over these resources. The better you understand these concepts, the easier today will be!

### 04:36 to 07:04 - Instructor Do: Initial Instructions

The next few activities will be spent incrementally building out our fullstack application. To make this easier to digest, we will tackle this in five phases .

Watch the video as through the timestamps listed below to hear the instructor's context on each of the phases. After each set of instructions, pause the video, complete that portion of the application, then unpause again to move on to the next phase. 

You can follow along with each set of instructions using `15-HotRestaurant` from your class activity files.

This activity will force you to push yourself much further than any of the previous challenges. Don't give up! After you get through this, you will have cleared an important milestone: you will have developed a fullstack application from scratch!

#### 07:10 to 09:56 - Phase I - Pseudocode

#### 10:02 to 14:03 - Phase II - Frontend + Server Creation

#### 14:10 to 15:26 - Phase III - API Routing + Frontend Delivery

#### 15:33 to 16:36 - Phase IV - Backend Logic + AJAX

#### 16:42 to 22:48 - Phase V - De-bugging + Bonus

### 22:55 to 34:25 - Recap + Class End

By this point you should have completed your first fullstack application. Congratulations! How did you do? Are there any areas of this process that you still need to brush up on?

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the application with the rest of class. Keep an ear out for suggestions on how to further improve upon this application. What do you think? are there any improvements that you would implement to your own application?

We _HIGHLY_ encourage you to watch the [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7RvQMW2DOg&list=PLgJ8UgkiorCmI_wKKVt5FlkTG63sQF6rr&index=3&t=0s) of this activity. It will help you better understand how to plan for this type of complexity in the future.

After that, class is over! Great work today. 

Happy coding!
