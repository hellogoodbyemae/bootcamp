## Unit 6.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - **Get your API key!**
    - Navigate to [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api) and request an API key. You will need it for today's exercises.
 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/rR47-ailwM4](https://youtu.be/rR47-ailwM4)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To solidify understanding of APIs, JSONs, and their roles in full-stack web development
    - To increase comfort working with APIs and AJAX calls in data-rich applications
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 11:23 - Instructor Do: API and AJAX Slide Show

Welcome to class!

Today, we'll start with a quick slideshow to recap the lessons on API and AJAX calls from the previous class.

Watch the video as indicated above, then head over to the next section for a warm-up activity involving a weather API.

### 11:29 to 14:31 - Students Do: The Weather in Bujumbura 

**Important:** By now you should have acquired an API Key from [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/api). If you haven't done this already, get it done now before continuing the video.

Once you have your API key, follow along with the video with `05-Bujumbura` from your class activity files. Listen to the instructor's context, then jump right in. Don't just look at the solution code! It is a disservice to yourself and your learning. This should be a warm-up using familiar concepts.

Once you are done review the solution in the following section.

### 14:37 to 29:47 - Instructor Do: Review Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

How'd you do? Be sure to research and concepts that you're still shaky with. The lessons from this activity will be relevant for the rest of the day.

### 29:53 to 31:12 - Instructor Do: Working Movie App Demo

In this section, the instructor will showcase the app that we will be building for the rest of the day.

Watch the video as indicated above, then move on to the next section to try it out yourself!

### 31:19 to 32:00 - Students Do: Movie App JSON Dump

The first step in building the app that we just reviewed is to check that you can query the OMDb API, and display the data that you get back.

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `06-MovieJSONDump` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

When you are done, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 32:07 to 36:23 - Instructor Do: Review Activity 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

In particular, keep an eye out for the use of `JSON.stringify(response)`. This method helps you convert the retrieved JSON into a string that can be put placed into text.

How are you doing so far? The next step is to add dynamic buttons to the HTML.

### 36:29 to 39:08 - Groups Do: Dynamic Movie Button Layout 

Let's build on our progress so far.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `07-MovieButtonLayout` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Keep in mind that there are "easy" and "hard" variants for this activity. Be sure to select the version that is suitable to your current skill level. If you're curious, you can always return and try the other variant!

When yo are ready, head over to the next section to review your work.

### 39:15 to 42:54 - Instructor Do: Review Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

By the way, this part of the movie app is particularly relevant to your upcoming homework. If you'd like to review the solution with a slower pace, check out the [video review](https://youtu.be/K1JDUkF94cs).

We are halfway done with this app! How are you doing so far?

### 43:00 to 43:29 - BREAK!

Let's take a quick break before the next round of progress. 

Stretch your legs. Get some water. Self care is important.

### 43:36 to 44:28 - Groups Do: Log Movie JSON & Click JSON Data Attribute

In this next section, we will use the Data Attributes to display data contained in JSON responses from the API.

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. As you watch, ask yourself. How does the pop-up "know" which movie name to display?

Then, follow along with the activity instructions using `09-ClickJSON` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

_Hint:_ You should use HTML `data-` attributes.

### 44:35 to 51:48 - Instructor Do: Review Activity 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

In the final section, you'll be pushing through to complete the app. Get ready!

### 51:55 to 53:49 - Groups Do: Complete Working Movie App

**NOTE:** In the video that you are watching, the class did not have enough time to review this activity. That does not mean that _you_ shouldn't finish the movie app!

Watch the video as indicated above to listen to the instructor's context on what the complete movie app should look like. Then, read the instructions contained within `10-WorkingMovieApp` from your class activity files.

As before, remember that there are "easy" and "hard" variants for this activity. We recommend that you remain consistent and stick to the variant that you used before.

Then, when you are done with the app, pull up the solution code provided by the instructional staff (reach out to a TA if you do not have it) to compare your results.

How did you do? Do you still have questions? The following section contains an optional activity for you to keep practicing.

### 53:55 to 54:11 - Bands In Town App (Optional) + Class Closing

Class is over!

Well, there is one final optional activity that we _strongly_ recommend you give a try.

Read through the instructions in the readme.md in `11-BandsInTown` from your class activity files. For your convenience, information on how to use query the Bands In Town API can be found [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0).

Give it a shot! Once you are done, review the solution code to compare your results. Overall, how would you rate you understanding of these concepts?

Be sure to swing by office-hours if you still have head-scratchers to clear up.

Happy coding!
