## Unit 6.3 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/b88-UTt2v1U](https://youtu.be/b88-UTt2v1U)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To further build mastery of dynamic element generation and AJAX calls
    - To provide "real-world" application development scenario that would require collaborative coding
 - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 10:45 - Instructor Do: Congratulations on your Full-Stack knowledge!

In today's class, you'll be building your first complete Full-Stack application. That may seem crazy, considering that we are only 6 weeks into the course. But, you actually have all of the pieces. Now it's time to put it all together.

Watch the video as indicated above to hear it firsthand from an instructor, including a brief glimpse at the complete application that you'll be building today.

Once you are done with this introduction, unpause the video and get ready for a few warm-up activities that will push you understanding of data storage and transfer in HTML and JavaScript.

### 10:52 to 11:24 - Students Do: Random Cat Activity

In this activity, you will render GIFs onto an HTML page, after pinging an API. Kind of like in your upcoming homework ;)

First, open up `12-CatButton` from you class activity files.

Then, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get the instructor's context for this activity. When you are done, head over to the next section to review the solution.

### 11:30 to 17:18 - Instructor Do: Review Cat Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

How'd you do? Be sure to research and concepts that you're still shaky with. The lessons from this activity will be relevant for the rest of the day.

### 17:24 to 18:36 - Groups Do: Ajax Triggered by Buttons

Let's expand on the above by using `data-` attributes to store information.

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `02-ButtonTriggeredAJAX` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

When you are done, unpause the video and head over to the next section to review your work!

### 18:46 to 26:54 - Instructor Do: Ajax Triggered by Buttons Review


Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Remember that you should have access to the solution code in your class activity files.

Again, these lessons will be relevant to your upcoming homework. If you'd like to review the solution with a slower pace, check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1JDUkF94cs).

How are you doing so far? We have two more activities to go that build on top of this, so be sure to correct your code before continuing.

### 27:01 to 36:38 - Instructor Do: Creating Elements Dynamically Demo

In this section, the instructor codes the solution along with the class.

Open `14-DynamicElements` from your class activity files. First, read the instructions in the readme.md. Then, follow along with the demo. 

Keep in mind, this is _really_ similar to the previous activity, so pay particular attention to the way that information is retrieved from the API, then stored in `data-` attributes.

### 36:44 to 37:30 - BREAK!

We have one more activity to go that builds on top of our work so far. But, first, let's take a break!

Take 15 minutes to stretch your legs and reflect on what we've been working on so far.

### 37:37 to 38:08 - Groups Do: Pausing GIFs 

Heads up, the class from the video that you are watching chose to leave this activity for a later time. That does not mean that we have to, though!

Still, take the time to watch the brief context provided by the instructor in the timestamps indicated above.

Then, open up `15-PausingGifs` from your class activity files. Using the comments provided in the code, add in the code necessary to provide stop/start animation to your application.

_Hint:_ The answer to the question, "how do you pause GIFs?" is the same as in the previous activities. Use `data-` attributes!

When you are done, find the solution code within your class activity files and review your work. Don't cheat and look at it ahead of time! You'd be betraying your own learning.

### 38:14 to 43:28 - Students Do: NYT Example

Alright, it's time for a longer activity that utilizes everything that you have learned so far; not just today, but since we started the course. Like we said at the beginning of today's class, we're going to build an end-to-end Full-Stack application. It's going to be awesome.

First, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to view a demo of the application that you'll be creating. Follow along with the instructor's showcase using with `16-NYTSearch` from your class activity files.

Then, build the application piece by piece. Follow each of the phases described in the `instructions` folder.

Be aware, this is a hard activity to do completely right. It will require you to code with some complexity and deal with bugs in retrospect. It's also a really great activity for gaining mastery, so don't cheat yourself and skip it.

Also, keep in mind that you'll be working on this alone, which is not ideal. Reach out to classmates who might also be working on this to see if you can form a team. Otherwise, take your time to complete it on your own. It is worth your time (and frustration) to get through this and understand _how_ it works.

When you are done-- or if you need some nudging along-- check out the [video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDD8NV3sbZo&list=PLgJ8UgkiorCmRwLl7YKfFxmNySuAhNdmC&index=6&t=0s).

Pace yourself, and take any necessary breaks to complete this activity.

Good Luck!

### 43:35 to 50:33 - Everyone Do: NYT Recap / Review

Remember, this was a _difficult_ activity that you just tackled. It's time to take a moment to reflect on our progress.

To close out the class, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above and listen top other students' reflections on this activity. How might they compare to your own?

### 50:39 to 51:09 - Class Closing

Class is over. Great work!

Today's class is a milestone in your learning. Bne proud of what you hav accomplished and take some time to rest and think about any lingering doubts or questions that you might want to bring to class for next time.

Happy coding!
