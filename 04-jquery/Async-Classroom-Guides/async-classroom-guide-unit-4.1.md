## Unit 4.1 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/y0joRZ7dJAQ](https://youtu.be/y0joRZ7dJAQ)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To gain a cursory understanding of the jQuery library.
    - To understand the steps needed to utilize the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM.
  - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 03:04 - Welcome + Today's class 

Make sure that you are comfortable and ready for class. This one can feel a little overwhelming, so make sure to give yourself time and space to get through it.

To start, watch the video through the timestamps above, and review the day's objectives one more time:

  - To gain a cursory understanding of the jQuery library.
  - To understand the steps needed to utilize the jQuery library to manipulate the DOM.

Keep in mind, we are continually updating the content based on student feedback, so the objectives show on-screen may not 100% match what's written here. The high-level goals remain the same, though, so focus on the core message: Today we will be your introduction to jQuery, a JavaScript library designed to simplify client side scripting. With it, you will be multiplying your JavaScript capacities in no time.

Once you are ready, hop on over to the next section for an introductory lesson: DOM Manipulation.

### 03:11 to 05:34 - Instructor Do: DOM Manipulation

As part of our lesson on jQuery, we must first learn what the DOM (Document Object Model). Effectively, it is the version of HTML/CSS interpreted by the browser. Throughout the day, we will learn how to dynamically change the DOM to alter the HTML content that is displayed to the user.

It's pretty neat stuff! Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to hear it firsthand from the instructor. If you are still hazy on the concept, checkout this [additional introduction to the DOM](https://css-tricks.com/dom/).

If you think you've wrapped your head around it, head on over to the next section for a quick demo on the subject.

### 05:40 to 15:00 - Instructor Demo: DOM Manipulation with Plain JS 

Open up `01-DOM_Manipulation` from your class activity files. Follow along with this instructor demo on altering the DOM using vanilla JavaScript.

Take your time! And be sure to jot down any questions that you'll want to bring to office-hours.

Once you are done, be ready for an activity where you will try this on your own.

### 15:07 to 16:14 -  Students Do: Generating HTML with Plain JS

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `02-JSDrinkList` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your work. How'd you do?

### 16:21 to 36:13 -  Instructor Do: Review Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity.

Heads up: This review is pretty long. This will start becoming more of a pattern as we progress through the course. Be ready with notes, and have your editor at the ready. You'll more than likely want to try things out as you see them play out in the class videos. Especially if you are correcting your own code!

If you'd like to watch a slower paced version of this same solution, check out the [activity review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_9-NeU2L_U).

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for another two-part lesson that introduces jQuery, then shows you how to accomplish what we did in this activity, with less lines of code, by leveraging jQuery.

### 36:19 to 40:56 -  Instructor Do: Introduce jQuery

As you have seen, JavaScript alone is not ideal for performing these kinds of HTML modifications. Instead, jQuery provides a simplified syntax for doing the same tasks.

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to learn about the origins of jQuery. As watch ask yourself, how come we think of jQuery as a "library"? Where is this "library" stored? And most importantly, how is it that we gain access to it?

When you are done, head on over to the next section for another demo on DOM manipulation, this time with jQuery.

### 41:03 to 54:19 - Instructor Do: DOM Manipulation with jQuery 

Open up `01-DOM_Manipulation` from your class activity files. Follow along with this instructor demo on altering the DOM using jQuery.

This section tends to trip students up, so don't be afraid to stop and review your notes. It takes a little while for it all to click, so be patient with yourself and keep pushing!

Once you are done, let's take a break.

### 54:25 to 55:12 - BREAK!

Time for a break. Take a few and stretch your legs. You've earned it.

### 55:18 to 01:09:57 - Students Do: Generating HTML with jQuery

Welcome back! Let's hit the ground running with a jQuery activity.

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `04-jQueryDrinkList` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your work.

### 01:10:04 to 01:11:34 - Instructor Do: Activity Review

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Be sure to follow along with the solution code provided in your activity files.

How'd you do? Are you able to understand how jQuery simplifies JavaScript for us? What kinds of questions might you bring to office-hours?

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for an introduction to onClick events.

### 01:11:41 to 01:14:49 - Instructor Do: On Click Basic

On-click events are super important! This is how you make your websites 

Open up `05-OnClickBasic` from your class activity files and follow along with the video through the timestamps indicated above to learn about selectors. The main takeaway is that they help you select anything in the HTML (buttons, headers, anything!)

Keep in mind, you may find the syntax of onClick events a bit confusing at first. This is one of those instances where just trying it out will help it make sense. So, when you are ready, head on over to the next section for an activity where you can give it a shot yourself. 

### 01:14:56 to 01:15:37 - Groups Do: Sandwich Clicking 

From here on out, we just have activities that should help you further understand these concepts.

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `06-SandwichClick` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your work.

### 01:15:43 to 01:20:30 - Instructor Do: Review Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. Be sure to follow along with the solution code provided in your activity files.

If you need it, watch the slower paced [activity review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BLReDBUZRk). It may give you a different understanding of how this all works.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section for an introduction to onClick events.

### 01:20:36 to 01:21:21 - Groups Do: Trigger Random

This is the last formal activity for the day.

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `07-TriggerRandom` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your work.

### 01:21:27 to 01:25:14 - Instructor Do: Review Activity

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. What kinds of lingering questions might you still have for office-hours?

When you are ready, head on over to the next section to close out today's class.

### 01:25:20 to 01:26:19 - Class Closing

That's it for today!

jQuery is one of the first big hurdles in the course. Having gotten through this introduction to the material is already a huge step in your development as an, err... developer. These are skills that you will use daily going forward.

Challenge: You may notice that there is still one more activity in your class activity files, `07-TriggerRandom`. The class that we took this video from did not have time to finish it. However, you are in the Async Classroom right now, so you can give it a shot yourself!

Then, check your code against the solution. How did you do? Do you need more help? Come to office-hours and ask any lingering questions.

Happy coding!
