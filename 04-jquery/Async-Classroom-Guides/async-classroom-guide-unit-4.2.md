## Unit 4.2 Async Classroom Guide

#### BEFORE YOU START:

 - Open the video link for today’s class: [https://youtu.be/kCvYpEU0MNM](https://youtu.be/kCvYpEU0MNM)
 - Be ready with your activity files from class. You will need them to complete the day’s activities.
 - Review the day’s objectives:
    - To use jQuery DOM manipulation to create simple games.
    - To gain an initial understanding of lexical scope in JavaScript.
  - Be sure to jot down any lingering questions that you’ll want to take to office-hours.

### 00:06 to 05:03 - Welcome + Admin Items   

Get ready. Are you comfortable? Do you have some water nearby? Class is starting to ramp up, so be ready for some more challenges.

Remember, all of this is difficult because it is so new. Over time, many of the things that frustrate you now will become second nature. More often than not, that's what learning feels like.

### 05:10 to 05:43 - Today's class

Let's take a moment to review the objectives. Watch the video through the timestamps above, and review the day's objectives one more time:

  - To use jQuery DOM manipulation to create simple games.
  - To gain an initial understanding of lexical scope in JavaScript.

Keep in mind, we are continually updating the content based on student feedback, so the objectives show on-screen may not match what's written here. The high-level goals remain the same, though, so focus on the core message: Today we will learn about For Loops to expand our knowledge of JavaScript.

### 05:49 to 08:47 - Instructor Do: Captain Planet Game

Today's first section is a demo for an interactive Captain Planet browser game. Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get an understanding of the game's mechanics.

This game is an example of what you can achieve using DOM manipulation.

When you are ready, head on over tot he next activity to try it yourself!

### 08:53 to 10:14 - Students Do: Pseudocode Captain Planet

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `10-CaptainPlanetGame` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your pseudocode.

### 10:20 to 18:46 - Instructor Do: Review Pseudocode

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity.

Listen to each students' description of their pseudocode. Compared to your own, how much more or less detailed is it? How about the instructor's solution?

When you are ready, head on over to the next section to actually code a new superpower for Captain Planet?

### 18:52 to 19:53 - Groups Do: Create a Superpower Captain Planet

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `10-CaptainPlanetGame` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your work. Which superpower did you give your Captain Planet?

### 19:59 to 22:45 - Instructor Do: Review Captain Planet 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity.

You'll notice as you watch this review that there is no recording of students' screens during their demos. Listen to the descriptions and try to imagine what the they are describing superpower might look like. Can you think of how they accomplished that?

Before moving on to the next section, try to create one more super power for your Captain Planet. This will help you  

### 22:52 to 27:02 - Instructor Do: jQuery Recap

Before diving deeper into some more complicated functionalities of jQuery, watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to recap what we've learned so far.

Use this time to confirm that you understand the building blocks of a JavaScript library like jQuery. And, remember, you don't have to memorize every aspect of it. You just have to understand _how_ it works, so that you can always find what you need.

Just like a real library.

When you are through, move on to the the next section to try another DOM manipulation activity.

### 27:26 to 30:27 - Groups Do: Fridge Game

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `11-FridgeGame` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your work.

### 30:34 to 45:16 - Instructor Do: Review Fridge Game

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity.

In particular, keep an ear out for explanations on the concepts of `.addClass`, `.attr`, and `.text`. These are critical to understanding how the solution works!

If you'd like to watch a slower paced version of this same solution, check out the [activity review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gC529k3KzmE).

When you are done, get ready for a break.

### 42:23 to 45:45 - BREAK!

Time for a break. Take a few and stretch your legs. You've earned it.

### 45:51 to 01:00:10  - Instructor Do: Crystal Example

Let's hit the ground running with another DOM manipulation example. Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to get an understanding of how this Crystal game works. 

Also, be aware that this example is directly linked to your upcoming homework, so take notes! You can follow along with this explanation using `12-CrystalExample` from you your class activity files.

When you are done, head over to the next section for an introduction to lexical scope.

### 01:00:16 to 01:07:21 - Instructor Do: Intro Lexical Scope

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to learn about lexical scope in JavaScript. Keep in mind, This section is going to get a bit theory heavy. Take notes and rewatch or research anything that does not quite click. 

In particular, keep an ear out for the term "nested functions". This is another _critical_ concept that might become a headache further down the line if you don't understand how it works.

When you are ready, head over to the next activity to start practicing with these concepts.

### 01:07:27 to 01:08:11 - Students Do: Lexical Scope 1 

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `13-ScopeOne` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

Should you need it, checkout the [MDN docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures). It may help you better understand what is happening with this code.

Once you are good to go, head on over to the next section to review your work.

### 01:08:17 to 01:20:36 - Instructor Do: Review Lexical Scope 1 

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. 

As you go through it, try to understand what we mean by "closure". Here are some key points to help guide you:

  - When the return value of outside() is assigned to insideOut, a closure is created.
  - A closure is an object that contains both a returned function and the environment in which that function was created.
  - The environment consists of any local variables that were available to that function when and where it was declared.

Think you've got it? head over to the next activity 

### 01:20:43 to 01:20:51 - Students Do: Lexical Scope 2

This part of the video consists of a still image of the instructions. Do not worry, you should still be able to follow the instructions contained in the readme.md inside `14-ScopeTwo`, from your class activity files.

As you go through this activity, try to pay attention tot he use of the keyword `this`. What is it for?

When you are done, head over to the next section to review your answers.

### 01:20:57 to 01:24:20 - Instructor Do: Review Lexical Scope 2

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to review the solution to this activity. 

The key takeaway here is that using the keyword this will only print content related to the object directly above it, not from the grandparent.

Think you've got it? Head on over to the final lexical scope activity to put your knowledge to the test.

### 01:24:27 to 01:25:03 - Students Do: Lexical Scope 3

This is the last activity of the day!

Go to the timestamp above and listen to the instructor’s context for the following activity. You can follow along with `15-ScopeThree` from your class activity files. Follow the instructions in the readme.md to complete this activity. 

When you are done, check out the solution in the next section to review your code.

### 01:25:09 to 01:40:02 - Instructor Do: Review Lexical Scope 3

Watch the video through the timestamps indicated above to listen to other students' solutions to this activity. Then, compare your code with the solution file.

How did you do? Don0't get discouraged if this was particularly difficult. Like we said at the beginning of class, it will get easier in time.

When you are ready, head on over to the next section to close out today's class.

### 01:40:09 to 01:41:37 - Class Closing

Should you want to keep practicing, check out `16-ColorCorrector`, from your class activity files. It is a bonus activity that might help you solidify your understanding of today's lessons.

And, that's it, you're done! Be sure to bring questions to office-hours if you still need clarifications.

Happy coding!
